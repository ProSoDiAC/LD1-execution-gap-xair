    Validation (t_v) ends in AUTHORIZED, DELAYED, DEGRADED, REVOKED or EXPIRED.
    Authorization, commit, release and effect are distinct steps:

    * AUTHORIZED      validated at t_v; nothing has been released.
    * COMMITTED       the atomic commit (t_c) appended the authorization to the
                      actuation log; still not released.
    * RELEASED        the gateway reports that it handed the command to
                      middleware or to a controller (t_m).
    * WITHHELD        the gate (t_g), the commit, or a release guard refused to
                      release an authorized intent.
    * EFFECT_CONFIRMED / FAILED   the actuator or controller reported that the
                      effect happened (t_a) / did not happen (e.g. a
                      version-conditional command was refused).
    * UNKNOWN_EFFECT  released, but no effect report is available (e.g. a ROS 2
                      publication without feedback); a later report can still
                      resolve it.

    No state means "executed" merely because the intent was authorized or
    committed.
